# NBA Player Management System
This is a file-based CRUD management system built in C that allows the user to manage the records of NBA Players.

## Features
Through a menu-driven interface, in this system, the user can choose to:
1. Add a new player
2. View all recorded players
3. Search for any recorded player
4. Update a recorded player's information
5. Delete/remove a recorded player

## How to run
Let's say you want to call the executable "NBA".
In your terminal, head to the directory where the project files are all located in. Once you get there, enter:
```
gcc main.c players.c -o NBA
```

Then to execute it, enter:
```
.\NBA
```
