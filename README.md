# NBA Player Management System
Currently, this system can:
1. Add a new player to the system
2. View all players that are in the system
3. Search for any player that is in the system
4. Update a recorded player's information in the system
5. Delete/Removed a player from the system

To execute this, type in:
**gcc main.c players.c -o NBA_PMS** (doesn't have to be called NBA_PMS, but you need to compile the .c files and -o to whatever name)
