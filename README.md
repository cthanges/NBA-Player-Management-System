# NBA Player Management System
Currently, this system allows a user to 1) Add players to a text file and 2) Display the logged players onto the terminal screen.

To execute this: type in gcc main.c players.c -o NBA_PMS (doesn't have to be called NBA_PMS, but you need to compile the .c files and -o to whatever name).
