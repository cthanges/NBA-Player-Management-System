# NBA Player Management System
Currently, this system allows a user to 1) Add players to a text file, 2) Display the logged players onto the terminal screen, and 3) Search a player from the file.

To execute this, type in:
**gcc main.c players.c -o NBA_PMS** (doesn't have to be called NBA_PMS, but you need to compile the .c files and -o to whatever name)
